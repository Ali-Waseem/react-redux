This is a simple example for using Redux using both way that are React-Redux & Redux-Toolkit in React.

THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR IDEA:

1 - React and Redux are 2 different things.
2 - We use redux-toolkit OR react-redux libarary to connect redux and react.
3 - Usage of both are little bit different but not so much.
4 - In the market mostly redux-toolkit is prefered.
